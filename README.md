# VaccinePredictor-H1N1
Predict whether people got H1N1 using data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey

## Overview
Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions, providing individual protection against infectious diseases while contributing to community immunity through "herd immunity." Understanding vaccination behavior is critical for designing strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, improve uptake, and ensure equitable access, especially during pandemics where timely immunization is essential to controlling outbreaks. This project involves analyzing and modeling vaccination patterns for H1N1 using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. 


## Objectives
- Identify demographic and behavioral factors influencing vaccination rates.
- Predict individuals or populations at higher risk of non-vaccination.
- Provide actionable insights to design targeted public health campaigns.
- Optimize resource allocation for vaccine distribution and education efforts.

## Data Sources
The National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey dataset, which includes:
- Vaccination status for H1N1 and seasonal flu.
- Demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics of respondents.
- Opinions on vaccine effectiveness and risk perception.

## Stakeholders
- Public health organizations (e.g., CDC, WHO) interested in vaccine uptake.
- Policymakers aiming to increase vaccination rates.
- Researchers and epidemiologists studying vaccination behavior.
- Healthcare providers involved in vaccine distribution and outreach.
