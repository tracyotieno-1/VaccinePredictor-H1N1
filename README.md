# Predicting H1N1 Vaccine Uptake Using Machine Learning Models
Predict whether people got H1N1 using data collected in the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey

## Overview
Vaccination is one of the most effective public health interventions, providing individual protection against infectious diseases while contributing to community immunity through "herd immunity." Understanding vaccination behavior is critical for designing strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, improve uptake, and ensure equitable access, especially during pandemics where timely immunization is essential to controlling outbreaks. This project involves analyzing and modeling vaccination patterns for H1N1 using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. 

The primary goal of this project is to support public health efforts by understanding the factors influencing vaccination uptake during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. By analyzing data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, the project aims to identify key demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal predictors of vaccination. This understanding is crucial for informing future vaccination campaigns.

## Objectives

- Identify key factors influencing vaccination decisions.
- Provide insights for public health vaccination campaigns.
- Evaluate the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics.
- Inform strategies for improving vaccine coverage and addressing hesitancy.
  
## Data Sources
The National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey dataset, which includes:
- Vaccination status for H1N1 and seasonal flu.
- Demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics of respondents.
- Opinions on vaccine effectiveness and risk perception.

## Stakeholders
- Public health organizations (e.g., CDC, WHO) interested in vaccine uptake.
- Policymakers aiming to increase vaccination rates.
- Researchers and epidemiologists studying vaccination behavior.
- Healthcare providers involved in vaccine distribution and outreach.
